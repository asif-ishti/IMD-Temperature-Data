#Note: This code calculates week number from January 1 and week 52 ends in Dec 30 (or 29 if it's a leap year).
#If you want to add the last one or two days of the year with week 52, you have to rewrite the code.
#You can get the day number of a year and starting from Jan 1, get the mean values for every 7 days.
#To add the last 1 or 2 days, you can use the modulus operator (%%) and 
#make a rule that if the remainder is <3, it will round the week days.
